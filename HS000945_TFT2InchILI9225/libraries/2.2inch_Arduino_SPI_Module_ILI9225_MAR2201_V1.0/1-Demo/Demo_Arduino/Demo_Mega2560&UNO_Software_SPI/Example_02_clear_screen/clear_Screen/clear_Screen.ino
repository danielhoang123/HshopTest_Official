// IMPORTANT: LCDWIKI_SPI LIBRARY MUST BE SPECIFICALLY
// CONFIGURED FOR EITHER THE TFT SHIELD OR THE BREAKOUT BOARD.

//This program is a demo of clearing screen to display black,white,red,green,blue.

//Set the pins to the correct ones for your development shield or breakout board.
//when using the BREAKOUT BOARD only and using these software spi lines to the LCD,
//You can use any free pin to define the pins,
//if you don't need to control the LED pin,you can set it to 3.3V and set the pin definition to -1.
//for example
//pin usage as follow:
//                      CS   RS   RST   SDI   CLK   LED  VCC   GND    
//Arduino Mega2560&Uno  A5   A3   A4    A2    A1    A0   5V    GND

//Remember to set the pins to suit your display module!
